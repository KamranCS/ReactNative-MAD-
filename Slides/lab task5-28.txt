Create an application that tracks the location of user. Display it on map view using marker 

Make this marker draggable./Or allow user to add marker on map click.
Add a circle around the user location of 100m radius.

On dragging the use location should change and also the circle.

Try the functions for converting the coordinates to address and see the difference 
in address for different coordinates.

In code for background location tracking, see the effect of different states Like
when app is in foreground
App is in background
app is closed.
